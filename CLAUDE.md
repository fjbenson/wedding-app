# Wedding App — context for Claude

A wedding planning app, built to eventually serve other couples, not just one.
The owner is new to development — explain things plainly, avoid jargon where a
normal word will do, and keep answers short unless asked to go deeper.

## Current state

Planning pass is **done**. There is a data model, a database schema and a running
Next.js scaffold. There are **no real screens yet** — just a placeholder page.

Nothing is deployed. No Vercel project, no Supabase project. The code is only on
GitHub.

## Architecture (decided, don't relitigate)

| Piece | Role |
|---|---|
| Next.js 15 | The app — screens *and* server logic in one codebase |
| Vercel | Hosts the Next.js app |
| Supabase | Postgres, Auth, and later Storage + Realtime |

**There is deliberately no separate backend service.** This was discussed at
length. The features that would justify one are covered:

- Chatbot streaming → runs fine in Vercel functions
- Guest-to-guest chat → clients connect directly to Supabase Realtime
- Photo upload → clients upload directly to Supabase Storage

The one genuine future gap is **scheduled/background work** (timeline reminders,
long agent runs). When that arrives, add a worker (Railway is the likely home) as
a *third* piece. Don't restructure the other two.

## Data model

Full explanation in `docs/ERD.md`. Schema in `supabase/migrations/0001_init.sql`.

Decisions worth preserving:

- **`weddings` is the tenant.** Everything hangs off it and carries `wedding_id`.
- **Access is via `wedding_members`**, which has a `role` enum already containing
  `guest`. Guest access ships as a new row plus new policies — never a rebuild.
- **Households are separate from contacts.** Invitations go to a household; RSVPs
  come from individuals.
- **RSVPs are per contact per event.** Day vs evening guests is standard and
  horrible to retrofit.
- **Suppliers extend contacts** via `supplier_details` rather than padding every
  guest row with empty columns.

## Conventions

- **All database queries live in `src/lib/db/`.** Nothing else imports the
  Supabase client. This is what keeps a future backend split mechanical — don't
  scatter queries into components.
- **Row-level security is the real access control.** Policies are built on
  `is_wedding_member()` and `is_wedding_host()`. App-level checks are a
  convenience, not the guarantee.
- Types in `src/types/db.ts` are hand-written and mirror the migration. Once a
  Supabase project exists, replace them with `npm run db:types`.

## Verifying changes

```bash
npm run typecheck     # tsc
npm run build         # next build
```

`supabase/tests/rls_isolation.sql` proves one couple can't read or write
another's data. Run it against a scratch Postgres with the migration applied
(stub `auth.users` and `auth.uid()` first — Supabase provides those). **Re-run it
whenever RLS policies change.**

## Scope

**MVP (in scope):** contacts, timeline/milestones, RSVP — host-only.

**Deliberately not built yet:** chatbot, guest access/RBAC, guest-to-guest
messaging, seating plans, gift registry, photo uploads, inspo page. All are
additive — new tables hanging off `weddings`. None require changing the above.

## Next steps

1. Owner reviews `docs/ERD.md` and confirms the model matches their wedding
2. Design pass (Claude Design) — mockups and design system
3. Build screens: sign in, dashboard (circle-with-dots hub), contacts, timeline,
   RSVP
4. Create the real Supabase project, run the migration, connect Vercel
